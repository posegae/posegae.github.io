		<p class="section_main_text">Hello! I'm a senior Computer Science major at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota.</p>
      		<p class="section_main_text">I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and first came to Carleton with the intent of double-majoring in math and English. Then I took Intro CS and was hooked. Now I'm interested in creating inclusive and accessible technologies, combining problem-solving and empathy to make a positive difference in people's everyday lives. I have professional experience in app development, software design, and have done research involving both machine learning and jellyfish. Feel free to check out <a href="projects">some of the experiences I listed below</a>, take a look at my resume, or <a href="mailto:posegae@carleton.edu">get in contact with me</a>.</p>
